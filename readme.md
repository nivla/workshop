This workshop is an attemp for studying op source libraries,

I want to improving my skills reading and writing code, I think i've
read enough books, there is a lot of libraries out there that I could dig in it and that is what I am going to do.

i'll start with reading and trying to reproduce the code of browsersync,
its a awesome project I always wonder how the project work and how they built in.

I think i'll  learn a lot of JS, Node and  good techniques.
